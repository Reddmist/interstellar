Build Process
===============

**Development of the `interstellar` project has been paused. Please check out the [JS Stellar SDK](https://www.stellar.org/developers/js-stellar-sdk/learn/index.html) docs for how integrate with Stellar using JavaScript.**

This document explains what the build process looks like in Interstellar.

You may want to begin with the [Getting Started](./) doc.

## Webpack

We're using [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io) for bundling and compilation because of its flexibility, performance and possible code optimizations. Webpack can not only bundle JS files but also stylesheets and this feature is very important in our modules environment.

## Javascript

Interstellar is built using ECMAScript 6 standard of JavaScript. We're using [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader) to compile it to ES5 code. We strongly encourage you to use [ES6 Modules](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features#modules) to load your files and export resources from your modules.

Interstellar apps have three entry points:
* `vendor.es6` - loaded in `<head>` section of your app and contains common Interstellar modules used by you app and modules.
* `head.es6` - loaded in `<head>` section of your app.
* `main.es6` -  loaded just before `</body>` of your app.

We will allow developers to create more entry points and change Webpack configuration in a near future.

## Stylesheets

_Read more about the css architecture in [solar css framework](https://github.com/stellar/solar) repo._

Interstellar apps use the Solar css framework, a framework designed to enable modules to adapt to different themes with ease. Interstellar apps and modules follow the architecture and style guide of the Solar framework.

Interstellar Module System frontend's building blocks are widgets. Every widget styles are attached to its controller. This means that when developer decides to use a certain widget its styles gets loaded too! But what if an application developer wants to change how it looks like?

Interstellar concatenates project files and then is using [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) to compile it. We're concatenating stylesheets in this order:

1. Add in the theming layers of the [solar css framework](https://github.com/stellar/solar) and load the styles and libraries from each of the theme layers. These mixins and variables can be used later by modules and the app.
1. We check your application `styles` folder and concatenate all `*.header.scss` files. It's a great place to add your core styles.
1. We concatenate all styles of loaded widgets.
1. We check your application `styles` folder again but this time we concatenate all `*.footer.scss` files. It's a great place to overwrite widgets' styles.

## CLI

[`interstellar`](https://github.com/stellar/interstellar) is our CLI tool that performs all of the compilation steps. Use:

* `interstellar develop` to open your application in a browser a see changes as you work.
* `interstellar build` to build you application.
