# `interstellar`

> ## Interstellar system is DEPRECATED!

The Interstellar Module System is an open [ecosystem of modules](https://github.com/stellar/interstellar/blob/master/docs/learn/module-list.md) that aims to make it easy to build a web application on the Stellar network. This repository (`interstellar`) contains a command line tool that standardizes the build process for Stellar web applications based on the module configuration.
